Today I made some mini leek Quiches. It was surprisingly easy. 

Crust
(from http://www.food.com/recipe/quick-n-easy-quiche-crust-18185)

1 cup flour
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup olive oil or 1⁄4 cup canola oil
1⁄4 cup ice water (I just used water from fridge)

Whisk flour and salt together
Whisk oil and water together. I put the mixture in the freezer to cool for 10 minutes. 
Make a well in the flour and then pour oil and water into the center. Use fingers to comb flour into the center until everything is just combined. 
I took pieces and flattened them out with my fingers and put them into a muffin pan. About enough for 8 mini quiches.

Dough surprisingly elastic and didn’t stick to cutting board.

Filling: 
Basic Quiche ratio: 
1 egg to 1/4 cup liquid.

3 eggs
3/4 cup milk / or any dairy mixture
salt
pepper

Sauteed some leeks and a chinese sausage in butter. On high heat until fragrant and cooked. I didn’t want them to turn limp so I just did it until I thought it looked ready.
Mixed into beat up egg mixture.

Made 8 mini quiches in muffin pan. Very impressed with the portions, very exact.
