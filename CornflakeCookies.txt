Inspiration: 
For this recipe, I’m thinking of arepas de choclo, in a delectable cookie form. I’m also inspired by corn flakes and cornbread. I’m looking for a distinctive corn flavor and a crunch with a chewy center. But I’m also thinking of cornflakes in milk.

Ingredients: 

1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons water
2 large eggs
1 oz white sugar
4 oz brown sugar

1 box of Trader Joe’s Cornbread mix
10 g of kosher salt
5 oz of corn flakes
2 oz of white chocolate chips


Method:

1. Brown the butter. Once butter is browned, remove from heat and add 2 teaspoons of water. Stir and place in freezer to cool down. 
2. White brown butter is cooling down, beat eggs and sugar until light and fluffy and forms thick ribbons, about 8 - 10 minutes on medium high beating speed. It is important that the eggs and sugar are well incorporated with air.
3. By this time the brown butter should be turning solid (opaque around the edges, and creamy when stirred). Beat into egg mix until incorporated, about 30 seconds on low/medium
4. Whisk salt into cornbread mix, then add mix to wet ingredients, mix until barely together, white flour should still be visible, on LOW speed and only for about 10 seconds
5. Add the cornflakes and white chocolate chips and incorporate until barely mixed, about 10 seconds on low speed. 
6. Scoop into balls and refrigerate it for at least half an hour before baking.
7. Bake at 325 F for about 15 - 20 minutes.

Post recipe notes: 
1. Trader Joe’s Cornbread mix had way more sugar than I was anticipated, so cookies came out very crispy
2. Good flavor, but I think the white chocolate chips didn’t taste very good. I was going for a milk and cornflakes flavor. I think maybe next time I should use either better quality chocolate chips (or experiment with marshmallows?)
