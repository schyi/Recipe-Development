One-Bowl Blackberry Cake

Ingredients:
*1 cup all-purpose flour
*1/2 tsp. baking powder
*1/2 tsp. baking soda
*1/4 tsp. salt
*2/3 cup sugar (plus 1 1/2 Tbsp. extra for top)
*1/2 stick (4 Tbsp.) butter, melted
*1 large egg
*1/2 cup milk (I use 2%)
*1 tsp. almond extract
*1 tsp. lemon juice
*1 cup fresh blackberries 

Instructions:
*Preheat oven to 400*F. Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan (I used a 10-inch tart pan, which worked nice, too). 
*In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. 
*Add the melted butter, egg, milk, almond extract, and lemon juice to the bowl and stir (by hand) until ingredients are well-combined and batter is smooth.
*Pour batter into the cake pan. Top with the blackberries and sprinkle the top of the cake with 1 1/2 Tbsp. sugar. 
*Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a wooden pick comes out clean when inserted into the center. (For the 10-inch tart pan, bake 18-20 minutes.) Cool on wire rack.
